# Regen Network Community Call
## December 11, 2025 — A Year of Building, Shipping, and Cultivating Regeneration

---

## Opening Words

Welcome to the final community call of 2025. For those joining for the first time and for those who have attended throughout the year, gratitude flows to all who have played both small and large roles in this year's accomplishments.

What a year it has been—volatile, headwinds in many directions—yet this community kept its head down, shipped, worked, and collaborated. As the slides accumulated over these past few days, illustrating the power of a network carefully cultivated over years, the sense of pride became palpable. This year marks an extraordinary moment of leveling up, pointing toward what becomes possible in the year ahead.

## Operations, Sales, and Partnerships

The operational landscape expanded significantly this year. Notable partnerships launched with Gaia AI, General.Fi, Mom Earth, and Klima. The Regen Commons came into being. The Green Proofing Series launched alongside major credit sales to Mercedes, Altos Planos, and Solana Foundation.

Events at ETH Denver and New York City Climate Week brought the community together in person. The Regen Coin page drew attention to the token, while the Liquidity DAO activated. A new Regen Network website homepage emerged, the transition to the new Regen Forum completed, and connections grew with RF4 and the Planetary Regenerative Trust—helping nest this deep work in larger systems oriented toward unlocking traditional capital at scale through donor-advised funds and other vehicles.

## The Regen Builder Lab

Looking back over this past year, the Builder Lab stands out as something remarkable that evolved naturally.

Originally created as an eco-credit builder lab space for those seeking support, community, and wayfinding, the scope extended this year to encompass all those working on regenerative projects, crediting or otherwise. This growth testifies to three truths: the enormous eagerness and interest people have in finding support and mechanisms to fund regenerative work; the overwhelming complexity of this space that everyone navigates; and the power of small gestures—a little goes a long way.

Spaces emerged around topics that sparked collective learning, uplifting and de-isolating everyone involved. Different demos showcased works in progress, creating a space that exists nowhere else in this landscape. The most remarkable part: whenever something new came online, thirty people would jump on a Zoom call to sandbox what was and wasn't working in a hands-on way that generated momentum after every session.

## Community Projects on the Regen App

By year's end, the unregistered projects mapping revealed something beautiful. The imagery and locations speak for themselves—people doing the work, bringing communities together to protect ecosystems, rallying around particular species. Australia, Ecuador, Ukraine, United States, Spain, Honduras, Colombia, Mexico, and beyond. This represents just a drop in the pond of what the app can serve, with people finding it organically. More awaits in 2026.

## Registry Growth and Evolution

This proved a landmark year for the registry—not just for the team, but for all methodology and project developers working to bring their efforts into being.

### Achievements
A new website launched, offering clarity and centrality. New projects and credit protocols came online. Hundreds of thousands of credits emerged across biocultural, biodiversity, and carbon categories. Program updates refined the process.

### Projects and Credits
Biodiversity and biocultural credits arrived from Terrazos, Air Brazil, and the collaborative biocultural Jaguar credits. Carbon credits from regenerative farms in the UK—carbon dioxide being pulled into soil—joined biochar credits and local carbon trust credits.

The registry website launched on the 24th and continued building out, with exciting momentum and refinement of resources like the Builder Lab driving activity in the credit protocol libraries.

### Program Updates
The Program Guide BT 2.0 issued to mainnet with updates. A Validation and Verification Program launched to address the sticking point of validator and verifier availability, which often proves cost-prohibitive. SeaTrees became the first project to run through this program in January—a collaborative partner with Ryan providing invaluable feedback.

A rework on tracing emerged, with special recognition to the TBJ Society who worked closely for several months early in the year, comparing the tracing standards to their standards plan and providing exceptional feedback.

Work consolidated and streamlined the registration review process using clear checklists of evidence and requirements across governing documents. This moves toward potentially machine-readable review processes—all in service of greater credibility, consistency, and efficiency.

### New Protocols
Many protocols added this year had been years in development, moving from initial concept through internal review, expert review, and finally launching as credit classes with methodologies. Sustainable science protocols fall under the Verity credit class. ERA and TTC issued updated versions. SeaTrees developed an overall marine ecosystem restoration protocol with modules for coral, kelp, and mangroves, with seagrass expert review proceeding in parallel with mangrove approval.

Eden represents a project along the lines of environmental stewardship—a man in a parish in the UK collecting vertebrate data for years, now translating that into a protocol with plans to scale across many parishes.

### Credits Issued and Forthcoming
Crop Intellect is working to launch their credit class and create projects to issue credits. More monitoring rounds from Ecometric projects in the UK will yield hundreds if not thousands of credits from regenerative agriculture projects. An expansion of that protocol into Czech Republic and Slovakia appears on the horizon.

### Darwin Initiative Grant
Through collaboration with Money for Madagascar, a Darwin Initiative Grant now supports work with groups on the ground and the University of West England to pilot a regenerative agriculture project with a local community in Madagascar. Similar to other biocultural credit work, this finds the sweet spot between funding communities to regenerate and protect their land while supporting them in learning more about monitoring, verification, and stewardship. 2026 will reveal much about bringing something like this to market.

### Looking Forward
AI agents from Gaia AI's work will test efficiency and diligence in the review process while developing ways to support incoming product development. Scaling protocols means new projects and more credits. The Builder Lab continues digging into all the hard edges of this space.

## Regen Tokenomics

The tokenomics team has been working on a liquidity push for the token and coin. A special purpose vehicle advances. A market maker operates actively on Base and Celo. A CoinStore Base chain listing arrived. Approximately seventy-five thousand dollars in liquidity now deploys on Base chain.

The economic model continues strategizing around outcomes, focusing on burn mechanics, dynamic paths forward reducing issuance inflation, and growing demand-driven burns. Next steps include refined parameters, governance modeling, and programmatic 2% eco-credit fee mechanisms for the Regen buy-and-burn.

A strategic shift moves from ledger-centric to movement-centric framing—Regen as a store of value aligning with Ethereum and Ethereum groups like the Commons. A new partnership with Klima launches a new protocol enabling Regen credits to enter seamlessly for purchase and retirement of high-quality carbon credits, with Regen having a voice in which credits the protocol absorbs.

Technical community operations deployed new high-fee automation driving steady buy pressure. A big pairing gains traction on Hydrax Fly on Base chain with about seventy-five thousand in liquidity and high APR earning HYDX from incentives.

### Multi-Chain Expansion
Cross-chain deployment expanded to Base with multi-chain support. A path toward a Liquidity DAO funded by 15% emissions redirected from community-driven provisioning emerged. Model-driven refinement through simulation sessions shaped emissions policy in economic weekly interactions. Exchange readiness for centralized exchanges and buyer journey optimization consolidated insights.

Token economy insights were documented extensively. Token utility ties to ecological outcomes, positioning Regen as an eco-currency linked to verified regenerative work. A tokenomics AI system helps buyers understand purchase and retirement pathways and global impact.

### Technical Upgrades
Regen Ledger 6.0 progress continues with Kaizen model support enabling smart contract functionality. More burn logic implements. The Regen Commons and Regen Funding launched. Eco.bridge and Bridge.eco improved marketplace flows for project onboarding, enabling bouncing between chains with retirements happening from multiple chains—most prominently Solana, which sees significant retirements.

### Community Coordination
Forty-six coordination sessions occurred this year, with twenty-five documented. Ethics guidelines published, strengthening open-source development and transparent pipeline management.

## The Regen Foundation Book

The Foundation had a busy year, but the book deserves special attention. It formalizes a beautiful artifact summarizing tremendous learnings, available through donations to the Regen Foundation.

A limited pre-release of fifty to one hundred copies rolls out now, with a larger set of a thousand coming. The goal: getting people in the Regen Network and regenerative economic space excited, then extending four or five circles outward. Audrey Tang, working with digital democracy and participatory governance, offered an endorsement. The Foundation's folk ID brought together many region-adjacent people not directly involved in ecological restoration.

The book contains three parts. One consists of mythologies and essays. The most exciting part is the IDK—an Infrastructure and Institutional Development Kit, a play on SDK (Software Development Kit). It's a workshop-playable card set for developing institutional design, with tear-out cards for workshopping. A whole pack ships to different corners of the globe, with documentation on people building DAOs in grassroots contexts blending regenerative technology, economics, and rights of nature.

A minimum one hundred dollar donation applies, with an open-ended request for contributions rather than a fixed price—asking what people would charge for something like this if offering it themselves.

The next Regen Builder Lab on Thursday, December 18th, will demo the IDK in its conceptual and technical layers, along with the whole book. That will be the last Builder Lab of the year, with many plans for the new year ahead.

## The Regen Liquidity DAO

For better or worse, this community hasn't focused heavily on the Regen coin over the years. The founders are ecologists. Everyone who joins cares more about actual soil, land, trees, and rivers. Figuring out tokens, tokenomics, and liquidity represents another world of learning.

This year, a group formed the Liquidity DAO to support that side of the effort. At launch, about fifteen thousand dollars in donations came from the community. A proposal passed to direct emissions to the Liquidity DAO—about 15% of all Regen emissions now fund liquidity efforts.

The main goal: boost token liquidity so people interested in entering or exiting the Regen token can do so. The primary deployment works with Hydrax on the flywheel effect. The Liquidity DAO purchased LP positions and used emissions for pool incentives. Currently about a 200% APR exists for anyone providing liquidity on Hydrax. Liquidity has grown nearly to one hundred thousand and should pass that threshold shortly.

### The Klima Partnership
Two days ago, Klima and Regen Network announced a formal partnership agreement, joining the launch of Klima's V2 protocol. This iteration differs from their first—slow, focused on very high-quality credits. Klima respects what Regen Network does and wanted Regen as a preferred partner upfront.

City Forest Credits will be part of the Klima V2 launch. Regen Network excels at connecting with on-the-ground projects, building protocols with them, and bringing credits to market. Klima focuses on collecting high-quality credits and getting them to buyers. They serve as an excellent partner for moving credits down the sales pipeline.

**A bold prediction: more eco-credits will be issued and sold next year than any year thus far.**

## Product and Software Highlights

### Regen App Improvements
A strong year for the Regen app brought Stripe improvements, Next.js migration for speed, and significant new features. The Stripe dashboard integration flow now allows users to connect bank accounts via Stripe from within the Regen application, enabling fiat sell orders for credits. Credits still list in stable currency to track sellers on-chain, but payment happens through Stripe with funds arriving directly in fiat.

The Next.js migration, worked on all year, improves application speed.

### Multi-Stakeholder Organization and Project Management
The most significant new feature enables multi-stakeholder organization and project management. Before, the Regen app lacked organization accounts with multiple team members or collaborative project management.

This introduces organization accounts and project collaboration with defined roles and differentiated functionality. All organizations and projects link to DAO DAO DAOs, enabling engagement with Regen app functionality while using DAO DAO applications for complex governance.

Node deployed DAO DAO on Regen Ledger and added a role-based authorization module. Previously, DAOs required voting on essentially anything; now certain actors can receive permissions to act without governance votes.

**Organization functionality allows:**
- Creating organizations (which creates a DAO on DAO DAO living on Regen Ledger)
- Migrating projects and credits or keeping them in personal accounts
- Managing members (owner, admin, editor, viewer roles)
- Creating projects
- Managing credits on behalf of the organization
- Signing data posts and transactions on behalf of the organization

**Project functionality allows:**
- Member management with the same roles plus contributor
- Granting land stewards or other actors access to upload data stream information
- Collective management of data posts
- Managing credits from the project DAO
- Using DAO DAO for voting on fund management and credit listings

Because all projects and organizations have DAOs, the DAO DAO app enables treasury management, sub-DAOs, and governance. Everything created in the Regen application appears on DAO DAO automatically.

This feature is live on DevNet at dev.app.regen.network. Bug reports welcome. Mainnet release comes in the next week.

### Ledger Upgrades
Two ledger upgrades occurred. The 0.47 upgrade enabled smart contracting and upgraded the data module to support IPFS as a resolver. After smart contracting enabled, Node deployed DAO DAO on Regen Ledger and added the role-based authorization module. Final testing proceeds for the 0.53 upgrade, supporting better integration with Ethereum and other VM ecosystems. A governance proposal should appear soon.

### Framework Working Group
The Framework Working Group—Sam, Paul, Corey, Austin, Giselle, and others—spent the year improving data standards for the ecosystem. The coding framework migrated to LinkML for better engagement with complex RDF data structures. Schema standardization completed for all credit protocols and projects on Regen Ledger.

A database now holds all credit protocols and projects in an Apache Jena instance, enabling queries against a consistent taxonomy and ontology for projects—geolocations, activities, and more. Claude Code integrations are in development to simplify access.

Work continues on a new data standards website. Automated SPARQL queries and Claude integration would allow LLMs to query everything happening in the ecosystem.

### Claims Engine
The claims engine work has been in conversation through the Framework Working Group, R&D, Marth, Hypercerts, and others. Austin developed a framework for structuring different stages of the claims engine process. A paper articulates this idea. An MVP of the claims engine builds on Framework Working Group foundations.

An architecture diagram shows interaction with the ledger, indexers, the Apache Jena instance, and applications. Energy and excitement flows in the Hypercerts and Marth realm, with work creating alignment between data standards and Hypercerts and EcoCerts.

## The Biocultural Strategy

The biocultural strategy brings cultural and social regeneration into crediting processes, specifically with indigenous communities in the Amazon where the first two pilots took place. This idea has become so compelling that projects in North America and elsewhere inquire about engagement.

### A Transformative Vision
This integrates ecological institution work, cutting-edge AI, but most fundamentally inquires: how do you truly empower indigenous people who have stewarded landscapes for millennia? Instead of imposing standards on them, how do we support them to continue expressing their culture—deeply bioculturally intertwined with the living ecosystem they belong to?

They know how to steward their landscape. We simply don't know how to honor that correctly in the Western market economy. Yet we depend on those ecosystems and the services they provide: oxygen, water, biodiversity. The idea flips crediting on its head, centering land stewards in governance, monitoring, and all core processes that make value legible and visible.

### The Jaguar Case Study
Beginning with 10,000 hectares with the community of Shadaminsa, the project expanded to three neighboring communities—four total in the lower Pastasa region. Credits live on Regen Ledger from these projects.

The vision: expand this protocol to help protect more than 30 million hectares in the upper Amazon through a financial mechanism centering indigenous communities in their own *plan de vida*—life plan—and community assembly processes. These represent the core stewardship paradigm operating successfully for millennia.

This work weaves into new bioregional finance facility designs with the BioFi project. A generation fund design—a sovereign indigenous wealth fund—incorporates this as a core component for tracking success and creating business strategies around ancestral stewardship services.

### PACTO: Technology-Enabled Translation
Central to all this is PACTO—a three-stage technology-enabled process translating community dialogue and governance processes that happen verbally in these communities into legibility for counterparty contracts such as biocultural crediting.

AI pipelines ingest voice-to-text while creating information loops where communities can deeply understand and upgrade counterparty agreements. Big intersections emerge with Pluralism Institute work and citizens' assembly processes, with collaboration on open-source tooling. This feeds back into DAO DAO technology and other participatory on-chain processes. A beautiful nested governance system emerges.

Many people have worked toward rooting legitimacy in ecological markets into human processes and vice versa. Until recently, with leaps forward in agentic technology, much of this proved difficult. Now it grows easier—very exciting indeed.

## Regen Commons

The Regen Commons represents another governance participatory process, stewarded by Stefan and the Regen Commons Stewardship Council including Patricia, Eve, Monty, and Afo.

The vision: out-cooperate the competition and walk the talk as a Regen movement. The mechanism involves the Regen trademark, which Regen Network is exclosing and asking a larger community to come together, co-own, and co-govern—a way of harmonizing and coordinating amongst a broader group.

Regen has become a protopian identity and culture transcending any single brand—a Schelling point for many organizations and people. Regen Commons brings together all actors uniting under that term, stewarding the movement for the benefit of all, curating and supporting public goods that strengthen the entire movement rather than concentrating on particular actors.

Recent exploration examines the market success of the Regen Web3 space, acknowledging room for improvement in financial numbers. Mechanisms under consideration include vaults or ways to aggregate capital into an endowment model allocating yield perpetually into funding the shared foundations of the regenerative movement.

The formation process continues working out strategy and options. A constitution exists for those who wish to understand the governance mechanics. Discussion happens on the Regen Coordination forum with a Telegram group for ongoing conversation.

## Gaia AI and the Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure

The collaboration with Regen Network since mid-year has produced remarkable infrastructure for the KOI network—Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure.

### Architecture
Sensor nodes act as scrapers ingesting content from various sources: podcasts, GitHub, forums, websites, Notion databases. Content flows through a data processing pipeline—chunked, embedded, processed into a knowledge graph. All of this flows downstream to AI agents answering questions and streamlining workflows, and to MCP servers plugging into various applications.

### MCP Servers
Several MCP servers now exist. One connects with the KOI for broad ecosystem information. Another, started by Jeancarlos and iterated upon, connects directly to Regen Ledger—answering questions about everything on-chain: eco-credits, registered projects. A recent server developed by Shawn helps with registry review, designed to assist the team in seamlessly registering projects and verifying incoming documents.

### The KOI Protocol
The Knowledge Organizational Infrastructure serves as the brain behind the scenes doing data processing. Block Science has been developing this open-source system—deep gratitude for their work. The protocol allows different networks to share information and collaborate. The goal: not just be a network but act as a node in a wider network facilitating knowledge sharing and combining.

### Current Capabilities
- Generating content digests
- Weekly digests
- Forum posts
- Podcast episodes
- Queries across the ecosystem

### The Regen Digest Podcast
A Regen AI team weekly update appears on the Regen Forum—an overview of this work plus deep dives into concepts like the Regen Brain as the KOI MCP. A call yesterday explored the Gaia AI vision and collaboration in greater depth; the recording will be shared.

The Regen Digest podcast launches soon on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube—a way to use AI tools for high-quality, high-signal information about the project.
