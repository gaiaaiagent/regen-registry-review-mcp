Hi Becca, let me know if you have any questions about what I posted regarding the Registry Review MCP. Looking forward to learning about your feedback and discussing more. Perhaps we can meet this afternoon, or tomorrow or early next week. My apologies that the development was slower than expected, I hit quite a few snags along the way and also had some particular distractions come up. I'm excited to work collaboratively with you and the team to make this a very useful tool for you and for the registry.

You can send me screenshots any time with like scribbles or notes on your thoughts. I'm all ears to any thoughts or direction that you would like to share at any point.

Hi Becca, my apologies for the delay, but I have finally reviewed the above.
Re-uploading / modifying documents (This might already work smoothly, but I'll verify this requirements)Final step of outputting the actual checklist (Makes sense! I can add this as a final step)Becca  [9:55 AM]
sweet- im hoping to jump into more testing here soon with the goal of end of next week having a usable process. would you be able to jot down the proper prompts? like asking for sessions, etc.?
shawn  [10:41 AM]
You should be able to get oriented with the agent without having any prompts in mind. I mean the only one I usually start with is 'List all sessions'. Other than that, you should be able to just get oriented from the agent itself by saying things like 'where did we leave off?' or 'what's next?' or asking any sort of process questions that come to your mind. Treat the agent like a colleague - that's the idea.
[10:41 AM]It should hopefully be pretty smart. But if it does trip up or get confused let me know!
Becca  [11:52 AM]
ah okay- sounds good. thank you
Becca  [11:44 AM]

Subject: Issuance Review Test Data Request

  Hi Becca,

  As we look ahead to the issuance review work, I reviewed the Fonthill and Greens Lodge zip files you shared, but they only contain registration documents (Project Plans, Land Registry docs, historic yields spreadsheets).

  For issuance testing, we'd need sample documents like:

  1. Monitoring Report (the primary document you mentioned)
  2. Sampling spreadsheets — the ones with specific columns like bulk density, sampling depth, sample counts
  3. KMZ files — with geolocation data for sampling locations
  4. Any supplementary evidence — emissions reports, lab results, etc.

  Do you have a sample issuance submission package we could use for development and testing? Even a partial set would help us understand the file formats and data structure.

  Also, a quick clarification from your video: you mentioned spreadsheets have specific column requirements (like Column V for bulk density). Is there a template or specification doc that defines what columns are expected, or does it vary by protocol?

  Thanks!
  Shawn[2:44 PM]^^ The above was written by an agent - I hope it makes sense
Becca  [7:40 AM]
Oh shoot yes-> here is a folder for issuance files and i popped the previous ones into a registration folder.

there isn’t a template for the spreadsheets on our end. they are mostly the same because they are coming from the same labs
