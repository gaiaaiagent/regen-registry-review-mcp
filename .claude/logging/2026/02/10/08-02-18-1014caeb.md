> OK did you finish everything?

<summary>`08:11:49` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> Yes, all 8 steps from the Phase 4 plan are complete:
> 
> - **Steps 1-7**: All security fixes implemented and tested
> - **Step 8**: `docs/architecture.md` was already tracked in git
> - **Security tests**: 20 new tests added across 6 test classes
> - **Existing tests**: Updated 7 test files to use valid-format session IDs (required by the new validation)
> - **Test suite**: 367 passed, 0 failed, 57 deselected
> 
> The only remaining item from the plan is **deploying to GAIA** — that's an action I'd want you to explicitly instruct. The changes are uncommitted and ready for your review whenever you'd like to commit.

> Did you push and deploy to production?

<details>
<summary>`08:13:13` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> No. Per the git protocol, I don't commit, push, or deploy automatically — I wait for your instruction.
> 
> The changes are sitting as uncommitted local modifications across 13 files. Next steps when you're ready:
> 
> 1. **Commit** — I'll stage and commit with an appropriate message
> 2. **Push** — push to remote
> 3. **Deploy** — SSH to GAIA and restart PM2
> 
> Just say the word.
