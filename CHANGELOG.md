# Changelog

All notable changes to the Registry Review MCP Server are documented here.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-22

Phase F productionizes the pipeline: model swap away from the slow GPT-OSS
endpoint, accepted-evidence schema-match gate for the over-scoring bias,
CI/CD workflows, release workflow with PyPI trusted publishing, and a
standalone HTML reviewer preview so humans can override verdicts without
editing JSON.

### Changed

- **Cache key now tracks the executor model.** Before Phase F, the cache
  key embedded `settings.get_active_llm_model()` (the Anthropic id)
  regardless of which backend actually served the call, so swapping
  between GPT-OSS / Gemma / Qwen silently reused a single cache entry.
  The new `settings.get_active_executor_model()` helper resolves the
  actual backend's model id; cache entries now differ per-model.
- **Cache key includes `PROMPT_VERSION`.** Any extractor-prompt change
  bumps `evidence_tools.PROMPT_VERSION` and automatically invalidates
  stale entries — no manual cache wipe needed.
- **Response cache TTL 7d → 30d.** Prompts change at release cadence
  (weekly, not daily); longer TTL means regression re-runs never burn
  cache unnecessarily.
- **Status determination requires schema match.** The classifier now
  promotes a requirement to `covered` only when at least one snippet
  has BOTH `confidence > 0.8` AND `schema_match=True`. Topical
  snippets that fail the accepted-evidence schema check land in
  `partial` instead of `covered` — the Phase E synthetic-mixed-verdict
  fixture's 13% over-scoring bias is closed by construction.

### Added

- **`EvidenceSnippet.schema_match: bool`** — defaults to True for
  back-compat with legacy cached responses and manual construction
  paths. New LLM responses set it explicitly via the tightened prompt.
- **Extractor prompt schema-check instruction** in
  `build_type_aware_prompt` — tells the LLM when to set
  `schema_match: true` vs `false` and why the distinction matters.
- **`settings.get_active_executor_model()`** — backend-aware model
  resolution for cache correctness.
- **`PROMPT_VERSION`** module constant in `evidence_tools.py`
  (currently `"v2.5.0"`) — bump whenever any extractor prompt changes
  output.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — fast suite + ruff lint/format on
  every push, matrix across Python 3.11 + 3.12.
- **`.github/workflows/regression.yml`** — regression suite on every
  PR to main; LLM response cache hydrated from `actions/cache@v4`.
- **`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`** — cross-model full-matrix run
  at 03:00 PDT, per-model cache namespacing.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — tag-push → fast suite → build
  → PyPI trusted publishing → GitHub Release.
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** — ruff + fast suite locally before
  every commit.
- **`docs/RELEASING.md`** — release checklist + PyPI trusted publishing
  one-time setup + rollback guidance.
- **`docs/CACHING.md`** — cache key semantics, invalidation patterns,
  CI integration, debugging recipes.
- **`tests/test_prompt_tuning_calibration.py`** — 18 tests covering
  `EvidenceSnippet.schema_match` defaults, prompt-template instrumentation,
  status determination logic with schema-match gate, `PROMPT_VERSION`
  discipline, and cache-key independence for both model and prompt
  version changes.
- **Reviewer preview (`src/registry_review_mcp/reviewer/preview.py`)** +
  Jinja2 template at `templates/review-preview.html.j2`. Renders a
  self-contained HTML dossier with override dropdowns, reviewer
  comments, and an Export-to-overrides.json button.
- **`tests/test_reviewer_preview.py`** — 13 tests for the reviewer
  preview renderer covering basics, snippet rendering (schema_match
  warning tag), override UX, file I/O, and defensive coercion.

### Phase F0 — model-swap sweep

- **Qwen 3.6 35B A3B rejected.** F0.1 smoke test hit Cloudflare 524
  timeouts on a trivial payload (378s wall-clock, 0 snippets returned
  after multiple retries). Endpoint is unhealthy; revisit in Phase G+.
- **Gemma 4 31B IT** passes smoke in 3.56s (vs GPT-OSS 4.46s on the same
  call). Full Burton / Rockscape / CSSCP sweep results documented in
  `phase-f/diffs/cross-model-sweep-*.md`.

### Performance

- TTL extension from 7d to 30d means `regression.yml` PR runs stay
  warm across entire release cycles, not just within one sprint.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-22

Phase E ports the Phase D two-layer cap pattern from spreadsheets to PDFs,
introduces a shared `PromptBudget` abstraction at the LLM-extractor layer,
and adds an aggregate throttle upstream of `call_llm` to bound the TELUS
Cloudflare gateway pressure observed during Phase D runs.

The motivating target was CSSCP's 554K-char Project Plan PDF, which was
starving REQ-012 (GHG Accounting), REQ-016 (Project Plan Deviations), and
REQ-021 (Safeguards). Phase D's 87% coverage number was the headline
signal; this release should flip at least those three missing requirements
into `covered` or `partial` once v2.4.0 baselines land.

### Added
- **`registry_review_mcp.llm` package** — new infrastructure module for
  shared LLM-layer gates. Contains `PromptBudget` (prompt-assembly
  budget with paragraph-boundary trim + footer annotation) and
  `Throttle` (aggregate concurrency + interval gate upstream of
  `call_llm`).
- **`_truncate_markdown_by_chars` helper + `MAX_CHARS_PER_DOCUMENT = 80_000`
  constant** in `evidence_tools`. Replaces the ad-hoc, unannotated 200K
  slice with a boundary-aware, footer-annotated trim at a much lower
  cap. The cap value was chosen empirically across four Phase E6
  iterations, each run against the CSSCP 554K Project Plan:

  1. **80K** — 14% retention, 21% gateway 5xx rate, **74% coverage**.
  2. **150K** — 27% retention, 65% gateway 5xx rate, **48% coverage**
     (retries exhausted on most pairs; silent drops).
  3. **200K** — 36% retention (Phase D's slice value), 76% gateway
     5xx rate, **35% coverage** — worst of the three.
  4. **80K** (final, cache-warm) — 80K was the only cap where the
     gateway stayed calm enough for retries to resolve reliably.
     The higher caps looked better on paper but saturated the TELUS
     Cloudflare gateway into 504 storms that the OpenAI-SDK retry
     budget couldn't absorb. At 80K, a second run reuses cache from
     runs 1–3 and settles above the first-run coverage.

  Burton + Rockscape Project Plans sit at ~62K chars, so the cap
  doesn't fire on them. Their cache keys match v2.3.0 exactly,
  regression gate holds by construction.

  Phase E accepts a CSSCP coverage floor below Phase D's cache-warm
  87% ceiling. The real recovery path is Phase G's section-aware
  truncation (preserve narrative §1–5 + quantification §4 +
  monitoring §5 verbatim, summarize the tail) which breaks the
  char-budget-vs-recall tradeoff.

  Truncation cuts at the last paragraph boundary below the cap and
  appends a footer citing the original and kept char counts so the
  LLM and downstream reviewers both know the payload is trimmed and
  where the full document lives on disk.
- **`PromptBudget` dataclass** with `max_document_chars`,
  `max_instructions_chars`, `max_schema_chars`, `max_total_chars` caps
  and `trim_document(content, source_name)` / `fits(total_len)`
  helpers. Default caps align with `MAX_CHARS_PER_DOCUMENT` so a single
  knob changes both the helper and the budget object.
- **`Throttle` + `acquire_slot()` context manager** upstream of
  `call_llm`. Env-configurable via `LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` (default 4) and
  `LLM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 100). Reports `active_permits_peak`
  and `calls_throttled` telemetry for Phase E closing journal analysis.
- **PDF char-cap regression tests** — `tests/test_pdf_char_cap.py`
  covers under-cap passthrough, over-cap truncation, footer annotation,
  paragraph-boundary preference, hard-cut fallback, and the
  `MAX_CHARS_PER_DOCUMENT` invariant.
- **PromptBudget regression tests** — `tests/test_prompt_budget.py`
  covers construction, trim delegation, fits semantics, and default
  factory behavior.
- **Throttle regression tests** — `tests/test_llm_throttle.py` covers
  semaphore depth enforcement, minimum-interval enforcement, env-var
  overrides, and peak-permit telemetry under load.

### Changed
- **`extract_evidence_with_llm`** now caps input markdown via the
  module-level `_truncate_markdown_by_chars` helper instead of the
  previous ad-hoc 200K slice. This is a tighter bound (80K vs 200K),
  produces a boundary-aware cut, and annotates with a footer so the
  model knows the payload is truncated and where the full document
  lives on disk.
- **`call_llm`** now wraps backend dispatch in
  `llm.throttle.acquire_slot()`. All three backends (Anthropic API,
  OpenAI, CLI) benefit from the same aggregate throttle. No behavior
  change when `LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` and `LLM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` stay at
  defaults on low-load workloads.

### Fixed
- **Unannotated truncation** — the previous 200K slice returned mid-
  sentence content without footer annotation, which could prompt the
  model to hallucinate continuation. The new helper cuts at the last
  paragraph boundary and annotates the cut explicitly.

### Performance
- **Gateway pressure** — early testing (see closing journal) measures
  504 rate vs Phase D under identical fixtures. Target: ≥50% reduction.
- **No expected throughput impact** at default throttle settings
  (`LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=4`, `LLM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS=100`) — the ceiling is
  the TELUS gateway's own RPS cap, which sat well below 40 RPS in
  Phase D observations.

### Notes
- Extractor-layer caps (`spreadsheet_extractor.MAX_CHARS_PER_SHEET` /
  `MAX_CHARS_PER_WORKBOOK`) remain as defensive defaults. The shared
  `PromptBudget` in the `llm/` package is the primary gate; extractor
  caps defend against callers that skip the budget (offline debugging,
  unit tests, direct extractor invocation).
- v2.3.0 regression baselines are archived under
  `tests/evaluation/baselines/archived/`; v2.4.0 baselines become the
  new reference once Phase E E6 runs complete.
- Phase E closing journal at
  `~/.claude/local/journal/legion/2026/04/22/<time>-ra-agent-phase-e-complete.md`
  carries the full numbers, telemetry diffs, and the
  `carboneg-csscp-v2.4.0-update.md` dossier update.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-22

Spreadsheet evidence is now visible to the evidence-extraction pipeline.
Previously, XLSX/CSV/TSV files mapped to a requirement were classified during
discovery but never converted to markdown in the lazy extraction path, so
`get_markdown_content` logged `No markdown available` and the LLM never saw
tabular evidence. This release closes that gap.

### Added
- **Lazy spreadsheet conversion** in `evidence_tools.extract_all_evidence` —
  XLSX/XLS/CSV/TSV documents mapped to any requirement are now converted to
  markdown sidecars alongside the PDF batch, using the existing
  `spreadsheet_extractor.extract_spreadsheet` implementation. Sidecar naming
  convention matches `document_processor.fast_extract_all` (`*.fast.md`).
- **Per-sheet and per-workbook character caps** in `spreadsheet_extractor`.
  `MAX_CHARS_PER_SHEET = 40_000` protects against a single fat sheet blowing
  the LLM-prompt budget; `MAX_CHARS_PER_WORKBOOK = 60_000` protects against
  the multi-sheet case where individually compliant sheets still aggregate
  past the gateway edge timeout. Both caps annotate the truncation in the
  markdown footer so the LLM (and the reviewer) knows the evidence is
  partial and where the full data lives on disk.
- **Phase D regression harness** — `tests/evaluation/test_v2_3_0_baseline.py`
  replaces the v2.2.0 regression suite. Parametrized over Burton Latimer and
  Rockscape Farms. Gated behind `regression` marker. Deselected by default.
- **Nine new fast-suite tests** across `tests/test_xlsx_lazy_extraction.py`
  (four tests covering the wiring: xlsx sidecar, csv sidecar, per-file failure
  handling, batch continuation past one broken doc) and
  `tests/test_xlsx_large_sheet_cap.py` (five tests covering the caps:
  row-cap trigger, row-cap non-trigger on small sheets, char-cap trigger,
  char-cap non-trigger, workbook-cap trigger on multi-sheet input).
- **Archived v2.2.0 baselines** — moved to
  `tests/evaluation/baselines/archived/` so any future investigation can
  replay against the PDF-only-era numbers. The active regression test only
  checks v2.3.0 going forward.

### Changed
- **Burton Latimer agreement rose from 95.7% (v2.2.0) to 100.0% (v2.3.0).**
  XLSX sampling plan records + historic yields now visible to the LLM;
  under-scoring dropped from 4.3% to 0.0%. Over-scoring unchanged at 0.0%.
- **Rockscape Farms agreement rose from 91.3% (v2.2.0) to 100.0% (v2.3.0).**
  Same mechanism; under-scoring dropped from 8.7% to 0.0%. Over-scoring
  unchanged at 0.0%.
- **REQ-017 Monitoring Plan systemic bias** (named in Phase C as Phase E's
  top tuning target) resolved incidentally — the XLSX sampling plans contain
  the monitoring schedule evidence REQ-017 was previously missing.

### Fixed
- Document dicts for spreadsheets now get `has_markdown`, `markdown_path`,
  `active_quality`, and `fast_status` annotated on successful conversion,
  matching the PDF lazy path convention, so `get_markdown_content` resolves
  cleanly on subsequent cache-warm runs.
- Removed redundant inner `from pathlib import Path` inside
  `extract_all_evidence` that had a subtle scope-analysis interaction with
  the module-level import.

### Performance
- Max XLSX markdown sidecar size dropped from 372K chars (pre-cap) to 55K
  chars after the per-workbook cap. Representative evidence rows are
  preserved verbatim; the remainder is summarized in a footer.
- Full-pipeline wall-clock on Burton Latimer (cache-warm Phase D re-run):
  36.7 min on TELUS GPT-OSS-120B. Rockscape Farms: 43.8 min.
- Cost: $0 (sovereign TELUS stack).

### Notes
- XLSX payloads routinely encountered Cloudflare 504/524 gateway timeouts
  on the TELUS GPT-OSS-120B endpoint during Phase D development. The root
  cause is edge proxy idle-timeout (~100 s) not token-budget exhaustion;
  the new char caps keep per-document prompts tractable without reducing
  the model's context window. Future work (Phase E+) may explore explicit
  concurrency throttling, prompt chunking for very wide sheets, and
  alternative edge routes.
- The `MAX_CHARS_PER_SHEET` / `MAX_CHARS_PER_WORKBOOK` values are empirical
  and tuned against observed TELUS behavior. Hosts with different gateway
  timeouts may want to relax them via a future env-var override.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-21

OCR fallback is now **enabled by default**. Image-heavy registry PDFs
(Ecometric Soil Carbon monitoring reports, InDesign-derived submissions,
scan-based inputs) recover text automatically when Tesseract is installed on
the host; text-native PDFs continue on the fast path with zero new work.

### Changed
- **OCR fallback default flipped from `False` to `True`.** Set
  `REGISTRY_REVIEW_OCR_ENABLED=false` to opt out. Hosts without Tesseract
  degrade gracefully — the `is_tesseract_available()` probe returns `False`,
  a one-time warning is logged, and the fast extractor continues on the
  native PyMuPDF4LLM output unchanged.

### Added
- **Benchmark fixtures** — `tests/fixtures/README.md` and
  `tests/fixtures/fixtures.toml` declare the env-var contract
  (`RRM_FIXTURE_BURTON_LATIMER`, `RRM_FIXTURE_BOTANY_FARM`), per-OS Tesseract
  install recipes, and the v2.2.0 Burton Latimer baseline (90.9%
  sparse-page rescue, +11.3% character recovery across 36 PDFs).
- **Default-flip regression test** — `tests/test_ocr_fallback.py` asserts
  `Settings().ocr_enabled is True` so any future accidental revert surfaces
  in CI.

### Notes
- Install Tesseract: `pacman -S tesseract tesseract-data-eng` (Arch /
  CachyOS), `apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng` (Debian /
  Ubuntu), `dnf install tesseract tesseract-langpack-eng` (Fedora), or
  `brew install tesseract` (macOS).
- Multi-language OCR (e.g. CSSCP Czech-Slovak submissions): install the
  extra language pack and set `REGISTRY_REVIEW_OCR_LANGUAGE=eng+ces`.

## [Unreleased] — feat/ocr-fallback (Issue #4)

OCR fallback pipeline prototype for image-heavy registry documents. Opt-in
via `REGISTRY_REVIEW_OCR_ENABLED=true`; disabled by default so existing
deployments are unaffected.

### Added
- **`extractors/ocr.py`** — new module with `is_tesseract_available()`
  (memoized probe via PyMuPDF's `get_tessdata`, graceful degradation when
  Tesseract is missing), `ocr_page()` (per-page OCR with auto / blocks /
  full modes), `page_needs_ocr()` (density-plus-image-blocks heuristic),
  and a deterministic cache keyed on `(filepath, mtime, page, mode,
  language, dpi)`.
- **`fast_extract_pdf` integration** — after the PyMuPDF4LLM pass, any
  page whose extracted text drops below the density threshold AND whose
  underlying PDF page contains at least one image block is OCRed, with
  recovered text spliced into the chunk under an
  `<!-- OCR-recovered page N -->` marker so downstream consumers can
  distinguish native from recovered content. The extractor return value
  now includes an `ocr` sub-dictionary (`mode`, `pages_recovered`,
  `language`, `dpi`) regardless of whether OCR ran, giving callers a
  stable schema to inspect.
- **Settings** — `ocr_enabled`, `ocr_density_threshold`, `ocr_language`,
  `ocr_dpi`, all with conservative defaults (`False`, 50 chars, `eng`,
  150dpi).
- **`tests/test_ocr_fallback.py`** — 18 tests covering probe memoization,
  graceful degradation when Tesseract is absent, one-time warning
  behavior, the density-plus-images heuristic, cache-key determinism and
  mtime invalidation, and the stable `ocr` schema on the fast extractor
  result.
- **Install helper** — `~/.claude/local/scripts/install-tesseract-for-ra-agent.sh`
  for operators on Arch / CachyOS, with Debian / Fedora / macOS hints in
  the script header.

### Not yet
- No accuracy / benchmark test against the Rockscape fixture — Tesseract
  is not installed on the development machine yet, so the next step is
  running the helper script and executing a marked-expensive fixture
  suite.
- No automatic enablement. Once the fixture run confirms precision and
  recall are acceptable, flip the default to `True` and add a
  configuration note.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-21

Packaging and distribution fixes so `uvx registry-review-mcp` resolves bundled
resources correctly without hand-patching cache environments.

### Fixed
- **[#2]** Checklists are now bundled inside the installed package at
  `registry_review_mcp/data/checklists/`. Previously `data/checklists/` sat at
  the repository root, so `_get_project_root()` resolved into site-packages
  (never the repository) after a PyPI install and every new uvx archive
  environment required manual population of its `lib/python3.13/data/checklists/`
  directory before `start_review` would succeed.
- Default `checklists_dir` now derives from a new `_get_bundled_data_dir()`
  helper that walks from `config/settings.py` to the package root rather than
  the repository root. Tests updated to use the same helper so they exercise
  the bundled path instead of the legacy repo-root location.
- Explicit `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` configuration so hatchling ships
  `src/registry_review_mcp` as the wheel's only package and non-Python resources
  under the package tree ride along automatically.

### Verified
- `uv build` produces `registry_review_mcp-2.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` containing
  `registry_review_mcp/data/checklists/soil-carbon-v1.2.2.json`.
- Full fast test suite green (`pytest`: 367 passed, 57 expensive deselected).
