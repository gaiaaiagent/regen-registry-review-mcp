2. # **Registry Agent Review Overview**

### **Registry Agent Role in Project Registration**

The Registry Agent serves as the primary evaluator for new projects seeking to register under the Regen Registry Program. During project registration review, the Registry Agent conducts a comprehensive assessment of the Project Plan document and supporting documentation to verify compliance with Program Guide and Credit Protocol requirements. The Registry Agent must ensure that all foundational elements are properly documented and all requirements have been met before a project can be registered on Regen Ledger.

### **Registry Agent Review Checklist**

The Registry Agent Review Checklist provides a systematic framework for evaluating project compliance with the Regen Registry Program Guide and associated Credit Protocol. The checklist is organized by key requirements, with each requirement referencing specific Program Guide or Credit Protocol sections, defining required evidence, providing space to document submitted evidence, and including approval status and Registry Agent comments. Each requirement is assessed individually with decisions based on concrete evidence. This structured approach ensures thorough review of documentation while maintaining consistency across different projects and reviewers.

### **Approval Categories**

Approval determinations are made based on concrete evidence submitted by Project Proponents. For each requirement, the Registry Agent must verify that submitted evidence adequately demonstrates compliance. When evidence is insufficient or missing, the Registry Agent documents specific deficiencies and required actions for the Project Proponent.

Approval Categories indicate whether a submission meets Program requirements.

* Approved: The submitted evidence fully satisfies the requirements   
* Not Approved: The evidence is either insufficient or missing, requiring additional documentation or clarification (note: projects may request requirements deviations is unable to provide sufficient evidence) 

Approval means that the Registry Agent found that the project fully met the requirements for project registration with the submission of the Project Plans and supplementary documentation.
