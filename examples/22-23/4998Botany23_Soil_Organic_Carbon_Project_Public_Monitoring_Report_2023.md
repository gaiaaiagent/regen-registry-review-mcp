### List of Terms


**Soil Organic Carbon**
Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is the organic carbon component of the total carbon content of
soil.


**Soil Organic Carbon Stock**


Soil Organic Carbon Stock (SOCS) is the amount of SOC contained within a defined area,
normally measured as tonnes per hectare (t/ha).


**Carbon Dioxide Equivalent**
To allow comparison between different emissions relevant to climate change, SOC is
converted to Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e) by multiplying by the molecular weight of
carbon dioxide (3.67).


**Carbon Balance**
Carbon Balance is also known as carbon footprint, it is calculated by deducting total farm
enterprise Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from the SOCS change, over the monitoring
period. A positive balance indicates that more CO2e has been added to the soil within the
project area than has been emitted by the food and fibre production within the project area
during the monitoring period.


**Mean Absolute Percentage Error**
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is defined as the mean of the absolute difference
between the sampled (SOCS(S)) and AI (SOCS(AI)) as a percentage:

#### **Carbon Balance**

The carbon balance after the baseline year and subsequently each monitoring period is shown
in Table 2. The methodology deducts total emissions and leakage from SOC Gains (converted
to tCO2e for equivalence) to calculate the carbon balance. The GHG emissions report
filenames are shown in Table 3.

#### **Appendix-A Methodology**

**Sampling Method**


Compact Geographical Stratification (CGS) was the chosen sampling design. The use of CGS
and equal size strata ensured that the average SOCS per stratum did not bias the total SOCS
value for each field. Fields were divided into an average of 3 (ha) strata (exact stratum size
was dependent on field size and shape). An average of 9 cores were taken in a grid pattern
within each stratum. The core depth was 0-30 cm. The cores within each stratum were
conflated to form an individual sample for laboratory analysis. Sampling was performed by C
A Agriculture using a WINTEX 1000s automatic soil sampler. The sample plan was saved as
Shapefiles and uploaded into the sample team’s control system. Each sample stratum was
assigned a unique label so that the location could be correlated with the data returned by the
laboratory. The location of each core was recorded by the sample team using an iPad+
Cellular Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), with an accuracy of +/- 4 meters. The
positions were recorded in WGS84, EPSG:4326 geographical coordinates. The core positions
were within 2m of the requested sampling plan locations.


**Change to Sampling Design from Baseline**


The soil sampling design for the 2022 monitoring round covered 50% of the project area, with
an average block size of 1 hectare and 40 cores per block conflated into a single sample. For
2023, the design evolved to cover 100% of the area or as close to 100% as was achievable
in the field conditions. To maintain financial feasibility, the sample block size was increased,
and the core density was adjusted. A computational investigation was conducted to assess
the impact of different block sizes and core densities on the SOC results and associated
uncertainty. The updated 2023 sample design represents the optimal combination of block
size and core density to balance financial cost with statistical confidence.


**Laboratory Analysis**


Laboratory analysis was conducted by a laboratory meeting BS EN ISO/IEC 17025, the British,
European, and international standard for analytic laboratories. The United Kingdom
Accreditation Service (UKAS) inspects and accredits laboratories that wish to claim
compliance with this standard. A laboratory that has been accredited by UKAS to ISO 17025
is permitted to display a Royal Crown Mark.


To give a complete audit of the carbon contained within the soil sampled, the following analysis
and calculations were conducted:


  - Soil Organic Carbon Stock (t/ha).

  - Soil Organic Carbon (%).

  - Organic Matter (%).

  - Total Nitrogen (%).

  - Total Carbon (%).

  - Carbon: Nitrogen Ratio.

  - Soil Inorganic Carbon (%).

  - Carbonate Class.

  - Bulk Density (kg/l).

  - Stone Fraction (%).

The carbon analysis was carried out using DUMAS method.


**SOCS Calculation**


SOCS was calculated from core depth (d), Bulk Density (BD) and SOC:


𝑆𝑂𝐶𝑆= d ∗BD ∗SOC (2)


Page | A-1




--- Page 11 ---

Changes in depth, BD or SOC will result in a change in SOC stock.


**AI Processing**


Multispectral reflectance data from satellite imagery was extracted for each sample location
and paired with its respective laboratory analysed soil sample value to create a training dataset
for the ecometric Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The trained ANN used the original
multispectral satellite image to estimate SOCS values for every 10sqm pixel within the project
area digital field boundaries.


The ecometric AI System requires predictors and responses to train. The predictors were the
pixel values from multispectral satellite imagery and the responses were SOCS values
reported by the laboratory.


The sampling plan allocated a laboratory SOCS value to each CGS stratum, representing an
average SOCS for the stratum. The average SOCS value was then allocated to each core
location within the relevant stratum. A QGIS tool was used to extract spectral values at each
core location for all bands used in the analysis. The predictors and responses were correlated
by location to create the AI training dataset.


A percentage of the training data was automatically partitioned by the AI and used during the
training cycle for validation and testing. The AI-estimated SOCS values (t/ha) were exported
as the georeferenced map. The MAPE was calculated from the difference between the
sampled and AI SOCS results.


**Accuracy**


To quantify AI performance a direct comparison was made between coincident AI calculated
SOCS and all laboratory reported SOCS values, reported as Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE). Although this is a comparison rather than an error it is applied as a deduction as a
potential source of overestimation. Net SOCS was calculated by subtracting the MAPE from
Gross SOCS, a conservative assumption of error.


**Greenhouse Gas Emissions Monitoring**


The estimation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions was carried out by the independent 3rd
party expert contractor, Cross Compliance Solutions (CXCS), a DEFRA-approved Agricultural
Auditor, using the Farm Carbon Toolkit IPCC Tier 2 calculator as defined in Appendix B. CXCS
are responsible for independent GHG emissions data gathering directly from the farm
management team and carry out all emissions calculator data entry to ensure consistency and
accuracy. This calculation process appropriately accounts for all Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG
sources emitted during the cropping season coinciding with the monitoring interval.

#### **Monitored Impact Information**


  - Data Unit: tonnes Carbon Dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

  - Collection Dates: as listed in Implementation Dates.

  - SOC quantities are monitored and reported as tSOC and tCO2e.

  - SOC change is the difference between the previous and current year SOC.

  - GHG emissions, for all food and fibre production emitted within the project area
during the monitoring period, are subtracted from SOC gains to report the Carbon
Balance.

  - A positive balance will be issued EcoCredits on the Regen Registry.

#### **Carbon Balance**


One EcoCredit will be issued per tCO2e positive carbon balance:
