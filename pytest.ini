# Markers
markers =
    smoke: critical path tests for instant feedback (target < 1s)
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, isolated)
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    marker: marks tests that use marker PDF extraction (very slow, requires 8GB+ RAM)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests requiring full system
    expensive: marks tests with high API costs (LLM calls)
    accuracy: marks tests for ground truth accuracy validation (real API, real docs)
